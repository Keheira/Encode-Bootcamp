# Question
What would a decentralised version of monopoly be like, if there was no software on a central server.

# Answer
The bank would be something like a DAO. The pieces would be the members of the DAO. If your not a member of the DAO you can't buy the properties. To prevent cheating I think you can make sure all the money funnels through the DAO for escrow, but I'm not 100% sure that's effective.

Thought about this when I was going back through the  video.
Using a single repo and git. Every commit is a move. The initial commits are setting up the bank amount and each player amount. You have to PR every change and get approval for all players
