# Encode-Bootcamp
place to store homework and projects for #ETHDenver Encode Bootcamp

## Homeworks
All homework files will be labeled `hw_*.md`. These are assigned after every class. I'll try to have 4 new ones a week.

## Projects/ Coding
I'm using Remix IDE Desktop so the files will be in the `Remix` folder.
